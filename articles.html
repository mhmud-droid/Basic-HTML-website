                    <h3>What Is Front-End Development?</h3>
                </header>

                    <p>
                        Front-end development primarily focuses on user experience. Using the related coding and design techniques, you as front-end developers build the elements of an application that are directly accessed by end-users with a goal of rendering the entire interface elegant, easy to use, fast, and secure, fostering user engagement and interaction.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As part of creating an engaging user interface, front end app development often focus on specific design elements such as text colors and styles, images, graphs and tables, buttons, and overall color schemes. These elements play a crucial role in enhancing the visual appeal and user-friendliness of the application. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Front end app development encompasses various interactive elements like sliders, pop-up forms, and custom interactive maps. An essential part of a front end application are navigational menus, which guide users through the application, enhancing their overall experience and interaction with the website or application. The creation of intuitive and user-friendly navigational menus is a key skill for front-end developers.

                    <h3>Front-End Development Versus Back-End Development</h3>
                </header>
                <main>
                    <p>
                        Hardware, computer programs, and websites comprise many components: code, databases, user interfaces (UI). Those that interact with users are in the front end; those that operate the technology are situated in the back end, also called the data-access layer. The back end provides the resources to support the front end.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        While front-end development is focused on what happens in the user interface, back-end development deals with what goes on behind the scenes. It is often perceived that front-end development is technically easier compared to the complexities of back-end development, which requires a solid command over programming languages, Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA), and data management skills.
                    </p>
                    <span>Here are the key differences between software development in the front end and back end:</span>
                    <dl>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <dt><strong>Back-end development</strong></dt>
                                <dd>
                                    is the process of building the components for running the application behind the scenes. Examples are components for data storage, infrastructure, integration with external systems, and code written in one or more programming languages. Users cannot access the back end.
                                </dd>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <dt><strong>Front-end development</strong></dt>
                                <dd>
                                    is the process of building components that interact with users. Examples are the user interface, buttons, user-entered data, websites, and user experience (UX) features. The front end aims at meeting user requirements and delivering a positive user experience.
                                </dd>
                            </li>
                        </ul>
